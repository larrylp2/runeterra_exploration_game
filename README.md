Using Clojure, explore the world of Runeterra through this text adventure.

Inspired by the world of League of Legends, this game focuses on the adventures of a new Demacian adventurer with the dangerous task to hunt down and subdue a magical shapeshifter that has infiltrated Runeterra from another world: Earth. Perhaps this shapeshifter was not the only thing that has crossed worlds?
